This planning involves a certain amount of media-buying, wherein third party media must be purchased according to the demands of the campaign. This is an incredibly messy process, with media planners often unable to sort through and adequately compare different publishers' offerings for sponsored content, such as articles or videos. \n\nIn this typical example, a media planner is given constraints by their organization. They need to hit two audiences served by two different publications.\n\nAssume Publication 1 {pub1} is a B2B-focused technology news platform that serves the Southeast Asia market, and Publication 2 {pub2} is a B2B-focused technology news platform that serves the ANZ market. \n\nPublication 1 receives higher viewership at lower cost, but serves a less valuable customer for readers of its branded content (measured in the click-through rates provided). Publication 2 receives lower viewership at higher cost, but serves a more valuable customer as defined by click-through numbers.\n\nThe task of the media planner is to maximize their given budget ($30,000) and allocate it efficiently across the two publications."

The slightly higher value of 30 more conversions per article for Publication 2 has resulted in a total conversion difference of 60 more, with a penalty of 8000 less views. Although minimums are hit, it is always difficult to justify the difference between the magnitude of these two numbers. 8000 more views or 60 more conversions? Media planners are often prone to this kind of magnitude fixation. The next step would be to see which of the two publishers have click-throughs that are turning into a conversion. One enterprise-level conversion can practically cover the expense of this campaign and then some in this technology industry.\n\nHowever, we are still left with $3000 remainder. This cannot really be avoided given the difficulty of fitting the prices for each publisher inside the stipulated budget.\n\nThe lesson here is two fold:\n\n1) Decide if your campaign is going to focus on conversion or awareness - while you can do both within the same campaign, publisher products may not be optimized for such across different markets. It is ultimately a little fruitless to compare views across vastly different geos if they display a pattern that inspired our View-maximizing solver. Conversions are likely more valuable for any performance marketer, so it would be pertinent to decide amongst those two early, especially in this B2B example.\n \n2) Always ask for budget after running an optimization...\n\n\nTo learn more about optimizing media budgets when selecting publishers, message me at jamin@campaignr.biz"
